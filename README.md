# Advent of Code
These are my attempts at solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. 

## [2020](./2020/src/)
Last year I wanted to use it as a project for improving my unit testing and continuous integration. That took too long, so this year I opted for quick solutions. My learning goal is to write a proper command line application using .NET Core. Optionally I can expand to unit testing later.

## [2019](https://github.com/Basje/advent-of-code-2019)
I only made it to Day 5. That repository should be merged into this one some day. This year I hope to get a lot further.
